# My Portfolio

My portfolio written in Angular 2, hooks into a mock api which will later be served via a nodejs backend. 

run `NPM install` and then `ng serve` to run.

The best showcases of my code are probably https://github.com/christos-z/my-site/tree/master/src/app/my-skills & https://github.com/christos-z/my-site/tree/master/src/app/skill

The site is also live here christoszenonos.com, the site is still very much a WIP, but I put it live last night so I could showcase it.

Kind regards. Christos Zenonos.
